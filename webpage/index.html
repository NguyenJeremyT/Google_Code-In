        <h2 id="subtitle">How I made this Website</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Step 1: Accepting the Task on Google Code-In</h1>
        <p>I stumbled upon the task on Google Code-In. I accepted it.</p>

        <h1>Step 2: Figure out the basic structure of a HTML page</h1>
        <p>I looked through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">the w3 schools tutorial on HTML</a> and figured out the general structure of an HTML page. I ended up using Notepad++ for my choice of editor.</p>

        <h1>Step 3: Figure out CSS</h1>
        <p> After that, I looked through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp">the w3 schools tutorial on CSS</a> and figure out CSS.</p>
        <h1>Step 4: Use BootStrap</h1>
        <p>I found out about <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">BootStrap</a> and figured it would look nicer and be more usable than my own pure CSS. I mostly used the <a src="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navbar/">navbar</a> and
            its
            container features.</p>

        <h1>Step 5: The Rest of the Website</h1>
        <p>This is when a made a little small changes. I made Roboto the font for the website using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Google Fonts</a>. Since I had to put an image, I put this <a
                href="https://unsplash.com/photos/7VOyZ0-iO0o">one from Unsplash (so I wouldn't be breaking copyright)</a>. After that, I had to figure out how to put text on an image, which took <a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/">[1]</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-transform.asp">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.html">[3]</a> links
            because apparently centering text is extremely difficult. The rest of the website is made up of purely h1 and p tags since after all the time I spent figuring how to center text on an image left me with only 1 day left of the task. :/</p>

        <h1>Step 6: Add a Favicon and Meta Tags</h1>
        <p>I had no idea what a favicon was so I looked it up on <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon">w3schools</a>. I ended up just using the favicon from <a href="https://fortnite.com">fortnite.com</a> because I had no creative
            ideas
            for a favicon. I found out what meta tags were on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">w3schools</a> too and added them in.</p>

        <h1>Step 7: Add a robot.txt file</h1>
        <p> No idea what this is. I used <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en">this website from Google</a>. I just followed the directions but after that, I was really hoping just to turn this in on time.</p>

        <h1>Step 8: Add a table and list </h1>
        <p> Oops. I forgot to add a table and list. I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_lists.asp">this website</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">this website</a>.</p>
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
                <th>Table</th>
                <th>Table</th>
                <th>Table</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Table</td>
                <td>Table</td>
                <td>Table</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Table</td>
                <td>Table</td>
                <td>Table</td>
            </tr>
        </table>


        <ul>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>List</li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Put it in GitHub</h1>
        <p> I used <p href="https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-website">this website</a> to figure out how to do this </p>

            <h1> What I learned </h1>
            <p> Well first and foremost, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and building a website with this. As someone who's mostly only good with programming and playing fortnite/video games, I guess I'm proud of this. After that, I learned that
                proper time management is a indeed necessary. I did like 20% in 2 days and 80% of the website in 30 minutes. I really regret doing this and I really feel like I could've made a better website. Anyways, thank you (whoever is reviewing
                this) for being a mentor on Google Code-in </p>
