# Google_Code-In
My projects for Google Code-In!

My first task (claimed December 10, 2019: 8:26 PM) was with Julia and it was an anagram function finder. It was my first foray into the Julia Programming language and it took a while to do. I didn't like it because I didn't think Julia was the right fit for me.

My second task (claimed December 23, 2019: 9:55 PM) was with JBoss. It was to make a website with HTML and CSS and it was a beginner task. I also didn't like making it too much.

I was looking for an organization to attach myself to when I found Wikimedia. I liked it because it offered a design task and I remembered that I'm probably better at design than most people (I'm not good, but most people in Google Code-in are coders).

My next task (December 26, 2019: 11:02 PM) was to make a logo for something called VideoCutTool. I made a pair of scissors with the colors spelling out VC (I'm quite proud of myself for that design idea).

Around here, I believe I decided that Wikimedia would be my organization, so I joined the IRC just to talk around. It was really cool. I went onto their dev channel and they have this bot that announces any bugs/changes. Some of my mentors complimented my logo (which did make me feel good). 
 
After that (December 27, 2019: 6:41 AM) was to work with a musical langauge (LilyPond). It was on this website https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:JeremyNguyenGCI#JeremyNguyenGCI. I just followed the directions for this one. It was really funny because while I was working on this, I was on the IRC channel and talking with some guy who turned out to be the mentor to this task specifically. Here's how the conversation went:

    Me: So, are you a developer?
    Them: Yes, in fact, I am a mentor for Google Code-in. I believe you are completing one of my tasks right now.

My next task was (December 27, 2019: 7:23 AM) was figuring how to use Gerrit (code review website) and submitted a patch. I believe I had to push a text file and I started it with "Hello Gamers" and my mentor was not a big fan of this.

Anyways, next task (December 27, 2019: 7:43 PM) was to make a video of me using VideoCutTool. I drafted a quick script based on the documentation and recorded myself using Firefox and OBS. Not too proud of this one since I sped it up by 1.5x to get under the 1 minute limit (I tried to be slow talking to make a good tutorial, but I ended up going over time becausue of this).

The next task (December 28, 2019: 10:53 AM) was a continuation of the LilyPond task. Basically, I had to use functions and variables this time. It was interesting... especially considering I had no prior understanding of music.

After that, the next task (December 28, 2019: 12:44 PM) I did was to design a logo for a tool that uploaded Google Drive images to Wikimedia Commons. My first iteration I used the Google Drive logo (personally, I was quite proud of this one: it used the bottom bar as an arrow). However, my mentor rejected this design since Google discouraged the use of its logo (even though the Google Drive logo is public domain but whatever). However, honestly I think this ended up making my logo better. I ended up combining the idea of the cloud with the Wikimedia commons logo, and the end result in my opinion is really creative.
