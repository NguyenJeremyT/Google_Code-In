# Google Code-in
These are my tasks for Google Code-in 2019. The majority of the tasks were for Wikimedia, but some were for Jboss and Julia. 

Most of these tasks are logos and other graphics. That is because Wikimedia uses Gerrit as their version control host. You can find my contributions to Wikimedia projects here https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/q/JeremyNguyenGCI.
